Results from up to 5 fusion callers tools are created, and are also aggregated, most notably in a pdf visualisation document, a vcf data collection file, and html and tsv reports.\n\nOn release, automated continuous integration tests run the pipeline on a full-sized dataset on the AWS cloud infrastructure. This ensures that the pipeline runs on AWS, has sensible resource allocation defaults set to run on real-world datasets, and permits the persistent storage of results to benchmark between pipeline releases and other analysis sources. The results obtained from the full-sized test can be viewed on the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/results).\n\nIn rnafusion the full-sized test includes reference building and fusion detection. The test dataset is taken from [here](https://github.com/nf-core/test-datasets/tree/rnafusion/testdata/human).\n\n## Pipeline summary\n\n![nf-core/rnafusion metro map](docs/images/nf-core-rnafusion_metro_map.png)\n\n### Build references\n\n`--references_only` triggers a workflow to ONLY build references, otherwise the references are build when the analysis is run:\n\n1. Download gencode fasta and gtf files\n2. Create [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) index\n3. Download [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) references\n4. Download [FusionCatcher](https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher) references\n5. Download and build [STAR-Fusion](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) references\n6. Download [Fusion-report](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/fusion-report) DBs\n\n#### Main workflow\n\n1. Input samplesheet check\n2. Concatenate fastq files per sample ([cat](http://www.linfo.org/cat.html))\n3. Reads quality control ([FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))\n4. Optional trimming with [fastp](https://github.com/OpenGene/fastp)\n5. Arriba subworkflow\n   - [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) alignment\n   - [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) fusion detection\n6. STAR-fusion subworkflow\n   - [STAR](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR) alignment\n   - [STAR-Fusion](https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion) fusion detection\n7. Fusioncatcher subworkflow\n   - [FusionCatcher](https://github.com/ndaniel/fusioncatcher) fusion detection\n8. StringTie subworkflow\n   - [StringTie](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/stringtie/)\n9. Fusion-report\n   - Merge all fusions detected by the selected tools with [Fusion-report](https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/fusion-report)\n10. Post-processing and analysis of data\n    - [FusionInspector](https://github.com/FusionInspector/FusionInspector)\n    - [Arriba](https://github.com/suhrig/arriba) visualisation\n    - Collect metrics ([`picard CollectRnaSeqMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037057492-CollectRnaSeqMetrics-Picard-), [`picard CollectInsertSizeMetrics`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037055772-CollectInsertSizeMetrics-Picard-) and ([`picard MarkDuplicates`](https://gatk.broadinstitute.org/hc/en-us/articles/360037052812-MarkDuplicates-Picard-))\n11. Present QC for raw reads ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/))\n12. Compress bam files to cram with [samtools view](http://www.htslib.org/)\n\n## Usage\n\n> [!NOTE]\n> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.\n\nAs the reference building is computationally heavy (> 24h on HPC), it is recommended to test the pipeline with the `-stub` parameter (creation of empty files):\n\nFirst, build the references:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/rnafusion \\\n   -profile test,<docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\\\n   --references_only \\\n   -stub\n```\n\nThen perform the analysis:\n\n```bash\nnextflow run nf-core/rnafusion \\\n   -profile test,<docker/singularity/.../institute> \\\n   --outdir <OUTDIR>\\\n   -stub\n```\n\n> [!WARNING]\n> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/getting_started/configuration#custom-configuration-files).\n\n> **Notes:**\n>\n> - Conda is not currently supported; run with singularity or docker.\n> - Paths need to be absolute.\n> - GRCh38 is the only supported reference.\n> - Single-end reads are to be used as last-resort. Paired-end reads are recommended. FusionCatcher cannot be used with single-end reads shorter than 130 bp.\n\nFor more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/usage) and the [parameter documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/parameters).\n\n## Pipeline output\n\nTo see the results of an example test run with a full size dataset refer to the [results](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/results) tab on the nf-core website pipeline page.\nFor more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the\n[output documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnafusion/output).\n\n## Credits\n\nnf-core/rnafusion was written by Martin Proks ([@matq007](https://github.com/matq007)), Maxime Garcia ([@maxulysse](https://github.com/maxulysse)) and Annick Renevey ([@rannick](https://github.com/rannick))\n\n## We thank the following people for their help in the development of this pipeline\n\n- [Phil Ewels](https://github.com/ewels)\n- [Rickard Hammar\u00e9n](https://github.com/Hammarn)\n- [Alexander Peltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer)\n- [Praveen Raj](https://github.com/praveenraj2018)\n- [Anabella Trigila](https://github.com/atrigila)\n- [Nicolas Vannieuwkerke](https://github.com/nvnieuwk)\n\n## Contributions and Support\n\nIf you would like to contribute to this pipeline, please see the [contributing guidelines](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).\n\nFor further information or help, don't hesitate to get in touch on the [Slack `#rnafusion` channel](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/rnafusion) (you can join with [this invite](https://nf-co.re/join/slack)).\n\n## Citations\n\nIf you use nf-core/rnafusion for your analysis, please cite it using the following doi: [10.5281/zenodo.3946477](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3946477)\n\nAn extensive list of references for the tools used by the pipeline can be found in the [`CITATIONS.md`](CITATIONS.md) file.\n\nYou can cite the `nf-core` publication as follows:\n\n> **The nf-core framework for community-curated bioinformatics pipelines.**\n>\n> Philip Ewels, Alexander Peltzer, Sven Fillinger, Harshil Patel, Johannes Alneberg, Andreas Wilm, Maxime Ulysse Garcia, Paolo Di Tommaso & Sven Nahnsen.\n>\n> _Nat Biotechnol._ 2020 Feb 13. doi: [10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0439-x).\n",
